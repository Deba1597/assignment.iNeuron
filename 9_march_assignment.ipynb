    "- PMF is used to describe the probability distribution of a discrete random variable, which takes on a countable number of values. The PMF is defined as the probability that the random variable takes on a specific value. In other words, it maps each value of the random variable to its probability.\n",

This means that as x increases, the probability that X takes on a value less than or equal to x also increases. The CDF can also be used to calculate the probability that X takes on a value within a certain range, by taking the difference between the CDF at two values.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The normal distribution is a commonly used statistical distribution that describes many natural phenomena and human-made systems. It is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric and bell-shaped, with the majority of the data clustering around the mean.\n",

The larger the standard deviation, the more spread out the data is, and the flatter the distribution becomes.\n",

    "- The shape of the normal distribution is determined by the values of μ and σ. If μ = 0 and σ = 1, the distribution is called the standard normal distribution. The standard normal distribution is symmetric around 0 and has 68% of its data within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations.\n",
