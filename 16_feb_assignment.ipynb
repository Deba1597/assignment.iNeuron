    "A database is a software system that allows users to store, organize, and retrieve data. There are two main types of databases: relational databases and non-relational databases (also known as NoSQL databases)\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases, also known as relational databases, are structured databases that use tables with defined relationships between them to store data. SQL databases are ideal for applications that require complex queries and transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that store data in flexible, schema-less documents or key-value pairs. NoSQL databases are ideal for applications that require high scalability and availability, such as large-scale web applications or big data analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "1 : Data Model: SQL databases have a predefined schema that specifies the structure of the data, while NoSQL databases have a flexible schema that allows for dynamic changes in data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 : Query Language: SQL databases use SQL (Structured Query Language) to query and manipulate data, while NoSQL databases use a variety of query languages, depending on the database type (e.g., MongoDB uses a query language called BSON).\n",
    "\n",
    "3 : Scalability: SQL databases are vertically scalable, which means that they can only handle increased traffic by adding more resources to a single server. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are horizontally scalable, which means that they can handle increased traffic by adding more servers to a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 : Data Consistency: SQL databases provide strong data consistency, which means that once a transaction is committed, it is immediately visible to all users. NoSQL databases provide eventual consistency, which means that changes may take some time to propagate to all users."

    "1 : Primary key: A primary key is a column or group of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row of data in the table. The primary key is used to enforce data integrity, as it ensures that each row in the table is unique and can be identified unambiguously. Typically, primary keys are created using a single column that has a unique constraint or a combination of columns that together are unique.\n",
    "2 : Foreign key: A foreign key is a column or group of columns in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. The foreign key is used to establish a relationship between the two tables, which can be used to enforce referential integrity. In other words, the foreign key ensures that data in one table corresponds to data in another table.\n"
